# GraphHopper Navigation SDK

When your users want to get from one location to another, donâ€™t push them out of your application into a generic map application.
Instead, keep them engaged with your application 100% of the time with in-app turn-by-turn navigation.

Our Navigation SDK for Android contains logic needed to get timed navigation instructions.

It is 100% open source and was forked 2018 from Mapbox due to [licensing issues](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/issues/1391).

It plays well with the open source [GraphHopper server](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-navigation).
